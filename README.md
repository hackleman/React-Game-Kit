# React-Game-Kit
This is a template I'm using to develop games in React.  This example includes a basic game using HTML Canvas with game state managed by custom hooks and Context.  A lot of useful hooks are provided for effortlessly managing the state of the game through the UI like pausing, starting, restarting and updating or displaying player attributes.
